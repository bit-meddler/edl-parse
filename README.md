# edl-parse
Tool to parse an AVID EDL and find take names and selected data regions

Really need a lot of example EDLs to sample and stress test.

##/loggingSim

Tool to simulate the generation of a 'Digi-Continuity' file representing a day of motion capture, or simalar aquisition ativity.

Potentially the rectangle representation could make it's way into a QT widget (drawing with .drawRect() etc).
